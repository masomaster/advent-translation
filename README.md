# Advent Translation 2023

[Go to deployed version](https://www.adventtranslation.com/)

## About

This is a project, modeled after [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), providing 25 days of translation practice from Hebrew and Greek verses in the Bible for the Christmas/Advent 2023 season.

## Technologies

Kept it simple to get it off the ground asap:

- React
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express

Hosted on Vercel

## Getting Started

In order to work on Vercel without refactoring on deployment, `node server.js` launches both the Express server and the react dev client.
